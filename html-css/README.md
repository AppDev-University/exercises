# HTML-CSS exercises

We’ve designed the following three exercises to give you some practice designing different web pages... and implementing those designs with HTML and CSS code.

When you complete each exercise, please follow these steps for posting your new web pages to us:

* Fork this github repo
* Create new HTML, CSS, image, etc., files somewhere in this “html-css” folder in your copy of the repo.
* Check them in and push them to github.com
* Don’t bother sending us a pull request - we’ll see your changes or you could just send us a quick email.

Thanks!

## Exercise One: Create a web page that uses left side navigation.

Please write HTML and CSS code to implement a web page that contains two columns: one on the left side containing a series of links or other navigation, and a second, main content area column. Here’s an example - Wikipedia:

![Wikipedia](https://github.com/AppDev-University/exercises/raw/master/html-css/images/meditation.png)

Source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation)

If you open up Wikipedia, for many pages you’ll see this kind of layout. On the left is a single, narrow column that contains a list of links. The main content area is a second column which automatically resizes as you change the size of the browser window.

* Please keep these requirements in mind:
* Do not spend a lot of time creating an exact replica of Wikipedia. We’re using Wikipedia as an example and not as a requirement. Your page can use any colors, sizes or content you wish.
* Please do not use HTML &lt;table> tags as the means for laying out the page.
* Instead, use CSS code wit &lt;div> tags to control the page layout.

## Exercise Two: Create a web page that uses right side navigation

Now repeat Exercise One, but instead create a page that uses a narrow column on the right side for navigation, while the main content area is on the left.

Here’s an example:

![RailsCasts](https://github.com/AppDev-University/exercises/raw/master/html-css/images/railscasts.png)

Source: [http://railscasts.com/](http://railscasts.com/)
This is a famous Ruby on Rails screen cast tutorial site run by Ryan Bates. You might want to watch some of the screen casts later when we start to learn about the Ruby langauge. However, for now if you open this web site and resize the browser, you’ll notice that the navigation bar on the right side retains the same width, while the main content area on the left changes width.

Same requirements:

* Do not spend a lot of time creating an exact of RailsCasts.
* Please do not use HTML &lt;table> tags as the means for laying out the page.
* Instead, use CSS code with &lt;div> tags to control the page layout.

## Exercise Three: Create a single web page that illustrates three types of CSS positioning

Create a single web page, or three separate web pages as you wish, illustrating these types of CSS position code:

* Absolute positioning
* Relative positioning
* Float left and/or float right, and make use of float clearing (i.e. display something that appears below and after the floating elements)

Feel free to be as creative as you want! You can position images, text paragraphs, controls/forms, links or whatever you would like.

## Exercise Four: Create your own blog page design

Now that you’ve practiced creating a few simple web pages, let’s go ahead and try something more ambitious: a blog page design!

* The only requirements are:
* An article page: this is the page that will display one of your blog articles.
* An “about” page: this will show some information about you... whatever you would like.
* A photo of yourself

Here are a few suggestions:

* Don’t try to do too much; designing a real web site is a difficult task!
* Don’t be discouraged if you have trouble getting started or have trouble getting a nice looking page.
* We will all be there to give you design and coding feedback soon; we’ll help you improve your designs and HTML/CSS code.
* Maybe get started by just drawing with pencil on paper.

Here are a few examples to give you some inspiration:

* [http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) - this is a very, very popular blog site with 100,000s of readers, but uses a very simple web page design with mostly white and black text, a simple logo and left side navigation.
* [http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/](http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/) - this one uses right side navigation instead, and displays a nice photo of the author (a famous Ruby developer).
* [http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/](http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/) - a fantastic user interface design by our one and only Daniel Higginbotham! Notice he doesn’t use left or right side navigation; there’s just a single text column.
